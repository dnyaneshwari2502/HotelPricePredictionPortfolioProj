I developed this small project as a personal upskilling initiative so that I could strengthen my data science and machine learning skills. It basically focuses on building a hotel room pricing prediction model using real-world booking data. I implemented model development, feature engineering, model evaluation and results interpretation. In this project I have used the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on over 119,000 hotel reservations, including variables such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, market segment, and average daily rate (ADR). My goal was to build a data-driven pricing model that predicts optimal room rates based on booking and customer characteristics. After cleaning and feature engineering steps, including the creation of total stay duration, total guests, and temporal variables, I implemented multiple regression models, trained and compared them. Among Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the XGBoost model performed best and then I manually fine-tuned it for improving accuracy. The final model achieved an R² of 0.78, showing strong predictive power in forecasting dynamic hotel pricing for revenue optimization.
